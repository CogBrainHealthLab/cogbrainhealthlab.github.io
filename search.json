    "text": "URECA/FYP students\nIf you are thinking about doing your FYP/URECA project under my supervision, here are some things to take note:\nThroughout your FYP/URECA project, you do not need to collect the data on your own, and you do not have to apply for ethics review. All the data you need for your FYP has already been collected— I have got a large database of neuropsychological, psychiatric and neuroimaging data from many healthy subjects, and clinical populations (e.g., mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, bipolar, ADHD, substance abuse). You can take your time to explore the different datasets to decide how you want to conceive your study. \nThe cons— the learning curve can be quite steep—you will need to learn to work with neuroimaging data using R or even a linux command line environment. Nevertheless I’ve prepared a lot of learning resources— lectures, worked examples which you can view at your own time. It will be helpful to have some previous coding experience (e.g., R, Matlab, Python), but this is not a strict requirement. Regardless of your level of experience in neuroimaging analyses, it is of utmost importance to have an open and inquisitive mind to learn new things—and on your own if necessary.\nWhile pursuing a neuroimaging research project may seem somewhat challenging, I have had URECA students who started out with very little or no prior experience in neuroimaging analyses; despite this, they still managed to complete impressive research projects using brain connectivity data. In fact, their research have been accepted for oral presentations at major international psychology/neuroscience conferences.\nSince you do not have to do any data collection or submit an ethics review application (unlike other students), I will need you spend the time that you would otherwise use to collect the data or work on an ethics application to help out in the recruitment and data collection of one of my ongoing research projects. This will probably take up 1-2 hours/week of your time. On some of your busier weeks (i.e., mid-terms/exams), I can excuse your absence, but overall, I expect you to actively participate, contribute and learn from one another within the lab.\n\n\nM.A./PhD positions — January/August intake\nContact me (junhong.yu@ntu.edu.sg) to discuss. More information regarding the M.A. /PhD programme at NTU psychology is available here"

The bottom panel depicts the distribution of ridge regression coefficients in the e) cognitive age-prediction and f) physical age-prediction models across 5000 random train-test split iterations. To facilitate interpretations, some of the coefficients for the predictors were sign-flipped (i.e., multiply by -1), such that for all predictors, a positive coefficient would suggest poorer performance corresponding to increasing age.

    "text": "Lab director\n\n\n\n\n\nYu Junhong— Assistant Professor of Psychology\nPhD, The University of Hong KongResearch interests: My research makes use of multimodal neuroimaging to study neuropsychology and cognitive aging in general. In particular, I am interested neurocognitive disorders, superior cognitive aging, neural predictors of cognitive decline and cognitive enhancement interventions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Staff\n\n\n\n\n\nCharly Billaud— Research Fellow\nPhD (Neurosciences), Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom\nResearch interests: Translational research involving neuropsychology and neuroimaging, including structural/functional MRI, DTI, and MEG. I have a particular interest in both aging and paediatric clinical populations with neurological disorders and developing markers of cognition and behaviour. My work involves structural and functional network analyses and graph theory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDexter Chew— Research Assistant\nBA (Psychology), University at Buffalo\nResearch interests: My research interests are in topics such as Mental Health of Elderly Patients, Elder Abuse with Long-Lasting Psychological consequences as well as Psychosocial Development of Criminals. I became interested in the mental health aspects of the elderly stemming from 2 years of working in the non-profit sector as well as being an active member of the grassroots level in Singapore. This has helped establish the different views and interests in the elderly being overlooked or becoming a marginalized group of individuals in society. Further interests in criminal psychosocial developments stemmed from an interest in reading serial killer bibliographies and documentaries that have led to a fascination of how the minds of hardened criminals are like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDionis Chong— Research Assistant\nBA in Psychology, Dublin Business School\nResearch interests: The general scope of my research interests include topics on creativity, intelligence and interpersonal relationships. Having been a gig musician for most of my life, the function of creativity relating to mental health and function as always been on the forefront of my curiosity. The skillset I’ve attained through learning how research is done in college allows me to pursue this question through a proper scientific means. I did my undergraduate thesis on Romantic Passion and Emotional Intelligence through Attachment Styles between the two biological sexes, which jumpstarted my interest in the inner workings of interpersonal relationships and how they relate to intelligence and mental functions. I hope to gain more skills within the neuroscientific sphere while working in this lab to enhance the quality of my research into these topics in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate students\n\n\n\n\n\nSavannah Siew— PhD student\nB.Soc.Sci (Psychology), National University of Singapore\nResearch interests: Neuropsychology, mindfulness, clinical psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanice Koi— PhD student\nB.A. Hons (Psychology), Nanyang Technological University\nResearch Interests: I am interested in using multimodal neuroimaging techniques to study the neurocognitive mechanisms of healthy aging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate students\n\n\n\n\n\nKayla Tan— FYP student\nResearch Interests: I am interested in the inseparable role brain functions have in psychological phenomenon, particularly ADHD; anxiety and depression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLee Zheng Long— FYP student\nResearch Interests: I am interested in understanding the pathology of affective disorders and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer’s disease. I seek to do so using neuroimaging methods, like structural, functional and diffusion MRI. Specifically, I use approaches like network neuroscience, DTI, and fixel-based analysis. I am also curious about the value of these neuroimaging markers as predictors of AD progression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllsie Lee— FYP student\nResearch Interests: mental health and it’s underlying mechanisms and management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandace Tan— FYP student\nResearch Interests: My research interest is in neuropsychology, particularly in neurodivergent populations and in neurodegenerative diseases. I seek to learn more about neuroimaging techniques and how they can be used to support research in these areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBryan Yeo— URECA student\nResearch Interests: My research interest lies in using neurocognitive assessments and brain imaging techniques to better understand neurodegenerative disorders associated with ageing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmilienne Ho— URECA student\nResearch Interests: I am interested in neuropsychology, especially how brain injuries or neurological disorders impact a person’s mental state and daily life. I hope that with access to neuroimaging techniques, I can study more about this effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNicolas Lok— URECA student\nResearch Interests: My research interests focus on psychiatric disorders, with a particular emphasis on anxiety-related disorders, as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. I am passionate about understanding the underlying mechanisms of these conditions and exploring potential therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac Teo— URECA student\nIsaac Teo— URECA student Research Interests: My interests are in the mechanisms of cognitive decline in ageing and its associated social, emotional, and behavioural outcomes. I am also interested in the development of interventions that delay cognitive decline and optimise brain health to preserve functions and maintain dignified ageing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Students\n\nFYP\n\nLisa Wong (2023-2024)\nTan Fu Miao (2023-2024) — Lee Kuan Yew Gold Medal, and Best Datablitz Presentation at AS4SAN 2024 conference\nAngel Lee (2023-2024)\nGenevieve Ling (2022-2023)\nCleon Chang (2022-2023)\nYuvaraj Arumugam (2022-2023)\nLoh Raye Fion (2021-2022)\n\n\n\nURECA\n\nKng Jia Hao (2023-2024)\nWang Jieqi (2023-2024)\nAlastair Khoo (2023-2024)\nXavier Lim (2023-2024)\nLee Zheng Long (2022-2023)\nGisele Cheong (2022-2023)\nCeline Chan (2021-2022)\nDan Yuet Ruh (2021-2022)"
